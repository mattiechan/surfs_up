# Surfs_Up

The purpose of this project is to analyze temperature trends determing whether or not it is a good fit to open a surf /ice cream shop. We are analazying temperature specifically on the months of June and December in Oahu. If the analysis is correct, it should lead to a profitable surf/ice cream shop. We are utilizing weather data from six weather stations in Oahu, Hawaii. 

## Three key differences in weather between June and December
1. Number of data points <br/>
• There are less data points from December (1517 data points) when compared to the month June (1700 data points). 
2. Distribution of data <br/>
• Temperatures wer more spread out in the month of December (std = 3.7) than in June (std = 3.3). <br/>

• December’s temperature stood at 71.04 °F and the median was at 71.0 °F. <br/>
• Maximum temperature of December was at 83 °F and in June 85 °F. <br/>
• Minimum temperature of December was at 56 °F and in June 64 °F. <br/>
3. Quartiles <br/>
• 1st quartile: 25% of all data is below 69 °F in December and 73 °F in June. <br/>

# Summary 

From our analysis, we can see that the isn't a huge difference in temperature between the two months. We do notice that there is a difference when it comes to rainfall when comparing the two months. December had a higher rate of rainfall (6.42 inches) and June with a rate of (4.43 inches). We believe that Oahu can be a potential location for a prosperous surf/ice cream shop from the analysis we did based on the data that was collected.
